# Covid Vaccination Application integrated with Gesture Recognition Model
- Built a **MERN Stack** Web Application for Tracking the updated Vaccination
Doses being administered word wide
- To make it userfriendly the Data is visualised using Maps and Graphs which
are Dynamically updated everyday
- To make it B2B product integration of Gesture Recognition Model using
custom gestures has been implemented using **YOLO Algorithm** as the
priority was speed and efficiency
- The social benefit is that itrecognises the vaccination status using sign
language which will help mute and deaf people to interact efficiently

# Covid Vaccination Application integrated with Gesture Recognition Model
### Introduction:
- Built a **MERN Stack** Web Application for Tracking the updated Vaccination
Doses being administered word wide
- To make it userfriendly the Data is visualised using Maps and Graphs which
are Dynamically updated everyday
- To make it B2B product integration of Gesture Recognition Model using
custom gestures has been implemented using **YOLO Algorithm** as the
priority was speed and efficiency
- The social benefit is that itrecognises the vaccination status using sign
language which will help mute and deaf people to interact efficiently

# Profile of the project:

### 2.1 PROJECT TITLE
The title of the project is VACCINE VISUALIZER & ANALYZER. It is a web page which contains the statistics of Vaccines Doses in India and Across the Globe. 
### 2.2 OBJECTIVE 
1.  It’s a website or framework which will focus on visualization of vaccine data across the globe.
2.  It will also consist of a ML model which will detect human gestures which will not only help in social distancing as it would reduce human interaction, but the second cause is it will help Mute and Deaf people as they can use sign language to communicate whether they are vaccinated or not.
### 2.3 PROBLEM 
Our Project basically focuses not on the COVID-19 problem rather it will provide the solution for the next step. As we have witnessed 2 massive waves of COVID-19 and a semi 3rd Wave. The next challenge is how we will be reacting after this as each step we take we should have this goal in out mindset that we should minimize contraction & encourage humanity to take precaution. The basic precaution is to get vaccinated and as we must live with this stupid and at the same time a dangerous virus which can mutate itself anytime. We can’t just abandon out social life, but the vaccination should be mandatory for engaging in any social activity. 
### 2.4 SOLUTION 
As the covid is almost over the restaurants, cafes, mall and other B2B & B2C would be opening at tremendous rate so our web-framework provides a dashboard where all can see the status of covid-vaccination. The web-framework provides the dynamic data of vaccine updating.

Visualizing and analyzing the total statistics of Vaccines across the globe using graphs and different maps which will be helpful to the customers. The graphs will help Analyze how various countries are progressing in their respective vaccine’s drives.

To make the user aware of the vaccines and COVID related news, updates and ongoings a News API has been integrated in the page.
An Object Detection Model also has been integrated to help the business industry to check the customers to detect whether the customer is vaccinated or not while maintaining the distance.
